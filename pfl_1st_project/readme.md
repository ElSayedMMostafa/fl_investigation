In this folder, I am doing my PFL first investigation project.

The jupyter notebook "novel PFL Investigation.ipynb" runs the PFL proposed algorthim (decoupling global and local models) on multiple test scenarios.
* To replicate the anaconda environment, use the following command in the anaconda prompt:
```
conda env create --file cloned_fl_env.yml
```
* After creating the environment, you can use the notebook safely.
